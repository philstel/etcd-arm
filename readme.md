# Running

From armv7 device

## Minimal commands

docker pull kylejw/etcd-arm
docker run -it -p 2379:2379 kylejw/etcd-arm /etcd
docker run -it -p 2379:2379 kylejw/etcd-arm /etcdctl

## etcd Discovery Service

This image contains only the etcd and etcdctl binaries.  In order to use the etcd Discovery Service you must provide trust certificates for https://discovery.etcd.io
The simplest way is to mount the trusted CAs from your host device: (suggested to mount in read-only mode)

Eg:

docker run --name etcd \
  -p 2379:2379 -p 2380:2380 -p 4001:4001 -p 7001:7001 \
  -v /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt:/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt:ro \
  kylejw/etcd-arm /etcd -name=etcd -discovery=https://discovery.etcd.io/....
